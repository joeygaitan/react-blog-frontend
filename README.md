This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Link to backend: https://github.com/joeygaitan/react-blog-backend

What I learned:<br/>
I learned how to use AJAX requests with axios to get data from an api with react. In addition, I learned how components and props works with react and a got a stronger understanding of react-router.

* To try out please fork and clone the backend and the frontend repositories.<br/>
* Then in both repositories please do npm i to install npm packages.<br/>
* in the backend do npm run dev to start the node local server <br/>
* in the frontend repository do npm start to run the frontend repository <br/>
